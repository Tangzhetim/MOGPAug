# Multi-Dimensional Wi-Fi RSSI Data Augmentation using Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP)
This project includes code for model construction using a data augmentation scheme with MOGP as the algorithm, excluding the filtering of data and specification of prediction locations and selection of kernel functions, using the UJIIndoorLoc database.
This repository hosts the code associated with the research paper "Multi-Dimensional Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator Data Augmentation Based on Multi-Output Gaussian Process for Large-Scale Indoor Localization," published in *Sensors*.
